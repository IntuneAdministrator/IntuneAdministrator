This interactive PowerShell script lists all current user startup programs configured 
in the registry. For each startup item, it prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog asking 
if they want to disable that program from running at login. If the user chooses Yes, 
the script disables the startup entry by clearing its registry value. After processing 
all entries, it displays a summary message showing which programs were disabled or 
if none were changed. The script runs under the current user context and uses Windows Forms for user interaction.
