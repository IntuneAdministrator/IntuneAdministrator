This PowerShell script checks if the device has a battery by querying system information. 
If a battery is detected, it prompts the user to confirm opening the Battery Saver 
settings page. Upon user approval, it opens the settings page and logs the action to 
the Application event log for auditing. If no battery is found, the user is informed 
accordingly. The script includes error handling and logs any errors when possible.
