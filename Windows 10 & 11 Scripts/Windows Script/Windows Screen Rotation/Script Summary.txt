This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog asking if they want 
to open the Screen Rotation settings page in Windows 11 24H2. If the user selects 
Yes, it launches the corresponding settings page via the ms-settings: URI scheme.

Regardless of the choice, the script logs the userâ€™s response in the Windows 
Application event log under the source "Screen Rotation Settings" for auditing purposes.

The script uses Windows Forms for the dialog UI and requires permission to start processes and write to event logs.
