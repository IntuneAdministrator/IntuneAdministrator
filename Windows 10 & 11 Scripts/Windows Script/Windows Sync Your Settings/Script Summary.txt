This script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to confirm whether they want to open 
the 'Sync Your Settings' page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user selects Yes, it launches 
the settings page and logs the action to the Application event log. If the user selects 
No, the script exits gracefully without performing any action.
