This PowerShell script retrieves detailed information about the current Windows operating system, 
including its version, build number, and installation date. It compares the OS version against 
a predefined list of official Microsoft End-of-Life (EOL) support dates. The script calculates 
how many days remain until the OS reaches its end of support and displays this information in 
a graphical MessageBox. It also provides recommendations if the OS is nearing or has passed 
its support deadline, helping users stay informed about their system's lifecycle status.
