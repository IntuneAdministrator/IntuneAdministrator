This PowerShell script queries the system for connected webcam devices by filtering 
imaging devices classified as cameras while excluding multifunction printers and scanners. 
If webcams are detected, it displays their names, statuses, and device IDs in a Windows 
Forms message box. If no webcams are found, the script notifies the user accordingly. 
The script also includes error handling that shows any encountered issues via a message box.
