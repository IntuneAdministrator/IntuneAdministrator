This PowerShell script tests internet connectivity by pinging a reliable host (google.com) 
10 times, then analyzes the results including packets sent, received, lost, and average 
latency. It displays a responsive Windows Form with a progress bar and status updates 
during the test. If the average latency exceeds 40 milliseconds, it warns the user that 
the internet connection is "super slow." Otherwise, it shows detailed ping statistics 
in a message box. The script also handles errors gracefully, informing the user if the host is unreachable.
