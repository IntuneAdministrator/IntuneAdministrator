This PowerShell script detects all connected webcam devices on Windows 10 and 11 
(including 22H2 and 24H2 versions) by querying device classes "Camera" and "Image," 
excluding multifunction printers and scanners. It performs a soft restart on each 
webcam by disabling and re-enabling the device using PowerShell cmdlets. The script 
requires administrator privileges to run and provides user feedback through Windows 
Forms message boxes, including notifications if no webcams are found or if errors 
occur during the restart process.

This approach helps resolve common webcam issues without requiring a full system reboot.
