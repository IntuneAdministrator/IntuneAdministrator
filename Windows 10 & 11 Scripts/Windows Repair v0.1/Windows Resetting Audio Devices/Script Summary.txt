This PowerShell script soft-resets all enabled audio devices on Windows 11 (version 24H2 and later) 
by disabling and then re-enabling each device classified under the "Media" device class. 
The process helps resolve common audio issues without fully uninstalling or reinstalling drivers.

The script requires administrator privileges and uses Windows Forms message boxes to provide 
clear user feedback, including notifications if no enabled audio devices are found or after 
the reset completes. Errors during the reset of individual devices are logged as warnings but do not halt the script.
