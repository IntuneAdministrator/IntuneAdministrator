This script repairs Windows system files and fixes corruption issues by running DISM 
and System File Checker (SFC) commands. It shows a responsive Windows Form with a 
progress bar and status updates throughout the process, which may take up to 30 minutes. 
Each step of DISM and SFC operations is logged to separate log files. Upon completion of 
DISM and SFC scans, the script displays message boxes to inform the user of success. 
The script requires administrative privileges and is tested on Windows 10 and 11.
