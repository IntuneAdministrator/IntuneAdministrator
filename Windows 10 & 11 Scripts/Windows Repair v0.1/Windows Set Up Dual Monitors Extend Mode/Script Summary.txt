This PowerShell script facilitates configuring a dual monitor setup on Windows 11 24H2 by 
extending the desktop across connected monitors. It first prompts the user with a 
confirmation dialog. Upon user consent, it checks the number of connected monitors 
via WMI and verifies that at least two monitors are connected.

If two or more monitors are detected, the script runs the built-in DisplaySwitch.exe 
utility with the /extend argument to extend the desktop across all connected displays. 
After applying the configuration, it notifies the user of success and advises adjusting 
resolution or primary monitor settings manually if needed.

If fewer than two monitors are connected or an error occurs, the script provides an 
appropriate message box warning or error notification. If the user declines to proceed, 
the script exits without making any changes.

The script uses Windows Forms for user dialogs and requires permission to query WMI and launch system utilities.
