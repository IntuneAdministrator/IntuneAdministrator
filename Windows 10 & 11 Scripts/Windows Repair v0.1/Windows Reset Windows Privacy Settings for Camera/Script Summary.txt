This PowerShell script resets the current userâ€™s camera privacy settings on Windows 11 
(version 24H2 and later) by modifying registry entries that control app access to the webcam. 
It accesses the user's registry hive (HKCU) to locate all app-specific webcam permission 
keys and sets their access values to "Allow", thereby enabling app access to the camera.

The script provides user feedback through Windows Forms message boxes, informing whether 
the operation succeeded, if no camera settings were found, or if an error occurred during execution. 
It requires to be run in the user context and does not override system-wide or Group Policy restrictions.
