This PowerShell script safely restarts the essential Windows audio services
AudioEndpointBuilder and Audiosrv â€” to help resolve common audio problems on 
Windows 11 (tested on 24H2). It requires administrative privileges to run and 
uses Windows Forms message boxes to communicate status to the user.

The script checks for admin rights, attempts to restart each service with error 
handling, pauses briefly between restarts, and provides clear notifications of 
success or failure. This method offers a quick fix for many audio issues without 
needing a full system reboot.
