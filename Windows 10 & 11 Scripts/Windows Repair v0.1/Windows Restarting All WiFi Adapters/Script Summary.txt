This PowerShell script restarts enabled Wi-Fi and Ethernet network adapters on 
Windows 11 (tested on 24H2). It identifies adapters by name that are currently 
active ("Up" or "Connected"), disables each one, then re-enables it to refresh 
network connectivity. This helps resolve common network issues without requiring 
a full system reboot.

The script requires Administrator privileges to run and provides user feedback via
Windows Forms message boxes indicating success or if no applicable adapters were found.
