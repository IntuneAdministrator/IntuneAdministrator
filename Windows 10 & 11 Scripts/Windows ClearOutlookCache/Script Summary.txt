This PowerShell script detects and forcefully closes all running instances of Microsoft Outlook, 
including both Classic and New Outlook versions. Once Outlook is confirmed closed, it 
clears the local Outlook cache folder located under the userâ€™s LocalAppData directory. 
This helps resolve performance issues or corrupted cache problems. Upon completion, a 
Windows Forms message box informs the user that Outlook has been closed and the cache cleared successfully.
