This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No message box to confirm whether 
they want to open the "Troubleshoot" settings page in Windows 11 24H2. If the user 
selects Yes, the script launches the Troubleshoot settings page and logs the action 
to the Application event log. If the user declines, the script exits without opening 
the page or logging anything. The script requires System.Windows.Forms for the UI 
prompt and appropriate permissions to write to the event log.
