This PowerShell script prompts the user with a graphical Yes/No dialog asking if 
they want to open the Sound settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user confirms, 
it launches the settings page (ms-settings:sound) and attempts to log the action to 
the Application event log. If the user declines, the script exits without making changes.

The script uses Windows Forms for user interaction and includes error handling for 
event log writing failures.
