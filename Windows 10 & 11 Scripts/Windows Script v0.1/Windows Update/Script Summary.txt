This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No message box asking whether 
they want to open the Windows Update settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user 
confirms, it opens the Windows Update settings and logs this action to the Application 
event log. If the user declines, the script exits gracefully without making any changes. 
The script requires System.Windows.Forms for the UI prompt and permission to write to the event log.
