This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to confirm if they want to 
open the Windows 11 24H2 "Themes" settings page. If the user agrees, it launches the 
Themes settings and attempts to log this action to the Application event log. If the 
user declines, the script exits without performing any action. The script requires 
permissions to use Windows Forms for the dialog and to write to the event log.
