This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to confirm if they want 
to open the Windows Update Advanced Options settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the 
user agrees, it launches the advanced options page and logs this action in the 
Application event log. If the user declines, the script exits without performing 
any action. The script requires System.Windows.Forms for the prompt and permission 
to write to the event log.
