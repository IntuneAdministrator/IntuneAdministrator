This PowerShell script prompts the user for confirmation to open the Windows 11 24H2 
Sign-In Options settings page. If the user selects Yes, it launches the settings page 
using the ms-settings:signinoptions URI and attempts to log the action to the Application 
event log for auditing purposes. If the user selects No, the script exits without making changes.

The script uses Windows Forms for a graphical Yes/No dialog and handles potential event 
log write failures gracefully by warning in the console.
