This PowerShell script prompts the user to confirm whether they want to open the Windows 
Security settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user selects Yes, it launches the Windows 
Security settings via the ms-settings:windowsdefender URI and attempts to log the action 
to the Windows Application event log under the source "Windows Security Settings". 
If logging fails, a warning is displayed in the console.

If the user selects No, the script simply exits without opening the settings page, writing a message to the console.

The script leverages Windows Forms for the user dialog and requires permission to start processes and write to event logs.
