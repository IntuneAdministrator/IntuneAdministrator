This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to confirm if they want 
to open the Sound Devices settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user agrees, 
it launches the settings page (ms-settings:sound-devices) and attempts to log the 
action in the Application event log. If the user declines, the script exits without 
performing any action. The script uses Windows Forms for the user interface and includes 
error handling for event log writing.
