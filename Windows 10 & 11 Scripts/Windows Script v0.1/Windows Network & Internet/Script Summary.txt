This script prompts the user with a Yes/No message box asking if they want to open the "Network & Internet" settings page on Windows 11 24H2. Based on the user's response, it either opens the settings page or exits. The user's choice is logged in the Windows Application event log for auditing purposes. The script requires permissions to write to the event log and uses Windows Forms for the user interface.
