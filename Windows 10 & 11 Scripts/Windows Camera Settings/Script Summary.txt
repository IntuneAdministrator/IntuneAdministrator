This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to confirm opening the 
Camera settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If confirmed, it launches the settings page 
and logs the action as an informational entry in the Application event log. 
The script ensures the event log source exists before logging and displays any 
errors in a message box if they occur.
