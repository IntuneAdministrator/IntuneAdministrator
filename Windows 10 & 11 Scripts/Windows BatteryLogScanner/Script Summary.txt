This PowerShell script first detects whether the device is a laptop or portable system by checking chassis types. If it is, it gathers detailed battery health information and displays it in a message box. Regardless of device type, it then scans the last 100 system event log entries for CMOS, BIOS, RTC, or battery-related messages and presents any findings in another message box. If no relevant events are found, it informs the user. The script includes error handling to gracefully report any issues.
