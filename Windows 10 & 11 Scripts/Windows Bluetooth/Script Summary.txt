This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to confirm opening the 
Bluetooth settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user confirms, it launches the 
Bluetooth settings page and logs the action as an informational entry in the 
Application event log. The script handles creation of the event log source if 
needed and displays error messages in case of failure.
