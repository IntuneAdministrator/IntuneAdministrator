This PowerShell script detects if the device has a battery by querying the Win32_Battery class. If a battery is present, it prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog to open the detailed Battery Saver settings page. Upon user confirmation, it launches the settings page and logs the action in the Application event log. If no battery is detected, the user is informed via a message box. The script ensures the event log source exists before logging and handles errors gracefully, logging any issues when possible.
