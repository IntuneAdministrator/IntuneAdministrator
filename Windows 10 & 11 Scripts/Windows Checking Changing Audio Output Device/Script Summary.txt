This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Windows Forms Yes/No dialog to open the 
Windows Sound settings page. If the user confirms, it launches the Sound settings and 
logs the event to the Application event log. If the user declines or if an error occurs, 
those actions are also logged accordingly. The script ensures the event log source exists 
and provides error messages via message boxes if necessary.
