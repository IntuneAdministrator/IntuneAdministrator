This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog asking if they want to open the Background personalization settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user confirms, it launches the settings page and logs the action in the Application event log for auditing. The script checks for and creates the event log source if needed, handles user cancellation gracefully, and logs any unexpected errors.
