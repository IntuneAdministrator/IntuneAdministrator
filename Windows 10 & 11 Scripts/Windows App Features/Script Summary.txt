This PowerShell script prompts the user with a message box asking if they want to open the Apps & Features settings page in Windows 11 24H2. If the user agrees, it launches the settings page using the built-in URI scheme and records the action in the Windows Application event log for auditing purposes. The script includes error handling to notify the user if something goes wrong and ensures that the event log source is created if it does not already exist.
