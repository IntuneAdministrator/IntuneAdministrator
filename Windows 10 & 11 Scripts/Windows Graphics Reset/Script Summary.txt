This script simulates pressing the key combination Ctrl + Shift + Win + B, which triggers a graphics driver reset on Windows. It uses embedded C# code to send these keystrokes programmatically, helping to resolve display issues like black screens or stuck graphics without restarting the computer. After the reset command is sent, it notifies the user with a message box confirming successful completion.
