This script shows a small progress window to simulate a task in progress. Once the simulated task completes, it collects detailed system information about the computer, including the operating system, hardware specifications, processor details, memory, and BIOS information. It then displays all this information in an easy-to-read message box for the user. If there is an issue retrieving the system data, the script informs the user with an error message.
