This PowerShell script retrieves the most recent system boot time by querying the Windows System event log for Event ID 6005 ("Event Log service started"). It calculates the system uptime by comparing the boot time to the current time and formats this information into a readable string. The uptime details—including boot time, current time, and duration—are displayed to the user in a Windows Forms message box.
