This PowerShell script prompts the user with a Yes/No message box to confirm opening the Apps & Features settings page on Windows 11 24H2. If the user agrees, it launches the settings page using the appropriate URI and records this action in the Application event log for auditing. The script includes robust error handling and ensures necessary event log sources are created before logging any entries.
