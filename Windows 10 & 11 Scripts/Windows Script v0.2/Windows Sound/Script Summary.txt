This PowerShell script creates a Sound Settings Dashboard with a WPF GUI for Windows 11 24H2. 
The dashboard features individual buttons for different sound settings such as Volume Mixer, 
Sound, Sound Devices, Default Microphone, and Default Audio Output. Each button opens its 
respective ms-settings URI and logs the action to the Windows Event Log.
