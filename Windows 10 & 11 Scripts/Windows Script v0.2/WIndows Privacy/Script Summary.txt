This PowerShell script creates a Privacy Settings Dashboard with a WPF GUI for Windows 11 24H2. 
It provides a vertical layout with buttons for various privacy settings like Account Info, 
Activity History, Camera, Microphone, etc. Each button opens the corresponding ms-settings 
URI and logs the action to the Windows Event Log. The grid layout dynamically adjusts based 
on the number of buttons, and the footer includes a signature. The script requires 
PowerShell 5.1+ and admin rights for event log creation.
