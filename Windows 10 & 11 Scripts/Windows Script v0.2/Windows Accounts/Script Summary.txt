The PowerShell script creates a Windows 11 Work & Account Settings Launcher GUI using 
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). It provides a graphical interface with fixed-width 
buttons for quickly accessing various system settings related to work, accounts, and 
personalization in Windows 11 (version 24H2). The interface is organized into a two-column 
layout, with each button opening a specific ms-settings page when clicked.
