This PowerShell script safely removes temporary files from user-specific and system-wide temp folders, clears the Windows prefetch data, and empties the Recycle Bin. It includes error handling to gracefully manage any issues during file removal. Upon completion, it notifies the user with a Windows Forms message box confirming successful cleanup. The script requires Administrator privileges for full access to all system locations.
