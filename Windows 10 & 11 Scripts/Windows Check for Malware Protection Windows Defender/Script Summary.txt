This PowerShell script presents a Windows Forms GUI to run a Windows Defender quick scan with real-time progress feedback. It checks and starts the Defender service if needed, runs the scan asynchronously to keep the UI responsive, updates a progress bar and status messages, and displays a completion or error message at the end. The script gracefully handles errors and ensures the GUI closes properly.
