This PowerShell script checks for a list of known applications that commonly use or 
lock the webcam (such as Skype, Zoom, Teams, Discord, OBS, ManyCam, and CyberLink). 
If any of these applications are currently running, it alerts the user with a warning 
message box listing the conflicting apps and prompts them to close these programs 
before using the webcam. If no conflicts are detected, it informs the user that no 
conflicting applications are running. The script uses Windows Forms message boxes 
for clear user notifications and is intended to be run before webcam-dependent tasks.
