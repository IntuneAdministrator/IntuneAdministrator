This PowerShell script locates and forcefully terminates all running Microsoft Teams and related processes. It then deletes the Teams local and roaming cache folders from the userâ€™s profile to fix issues caused by corrupted or bloated cache data. Upon successful cleanup, it notifies the user with a Windows Forms message box confirming that the Teams cache and temporary files have been cleared.
