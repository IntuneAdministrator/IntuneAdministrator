This PowerShell script is designed for Windows 11 24H2 systems to check if the device supports Advanced Display Settings by querying video controller information. If supported, it prompts the user via a Windows Forms message box to confirm whether they want to open the Advanced Display Settings page in the Windows Settings app.

User Confirmation: The script uses a Yes/No message box to get user consent before launching the settings page.

Action Logging: If the user chooses to open the page, the script logs this action to the Windows Application event log for auditing purposes, creating the event source if it does not already exist.

Graceful Handling: If advanced display settings are not supported, or if an error occurs, informative message boxes notify the user accordingly.

Best Practices: The script leverages modern CIM cmdlets, detailed comments, and proper error handling to ensure reliability and maintainability by senior IT professionals.
