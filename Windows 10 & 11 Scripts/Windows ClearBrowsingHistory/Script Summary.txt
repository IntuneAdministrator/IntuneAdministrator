This PowerShell script clears browsing history, cookies, session data, and other cached information for Microsoft Edge (Default profile) and Internet Explorer. It deletes key data files and folders from Edge’s user data directory and invokes Internet Explorer’s built-in cleanup routines via InetCpl.cpl. Additionally, it configures Internet Explorer to automatically clear browsing history on exit by modifying the registry. After completing the cleanup, the script displays a Windows Forms message box confirming the successful operation.
