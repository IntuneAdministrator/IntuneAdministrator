This script performs a silent full repair of Microsoft Office using the OfficeClickToRun.exe tool. It first checks if it is running with Administrator privileges and, if not, restarts itself with elevated rights. Once running as Administrator, it launches the Office full repair process silently without user interaction. After starting the repair, it waits briefly and then informs the user with a message box that the repair has been initiated, allowing them to continue using their computer.
