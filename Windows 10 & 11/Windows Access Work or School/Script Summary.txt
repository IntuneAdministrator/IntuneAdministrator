This PowerShell script checks whether a Windows 11 24H2 device is connected to a work or school account by using the built-in dsregcmd /status command. It parses the output to determine if the device is Azure AD joined or Workplace joined. The script then displays the status to the user in a Windows Forms MessageBox.

If the device is connected to a work or school account, the script shows an informational message.

If the device is not connected, it prompts the user with a Yes/No dialog asking if they want to open the “Access Work or School” settings page.

Upon user confirmation, it launches the settings page to allow account connection.

Includes robust error handling with clear feedback to the user.

This script is designed for IT professionals managing enterprise environments to verify enrollment status with minimal user disruption and optional direct access to account settings.
