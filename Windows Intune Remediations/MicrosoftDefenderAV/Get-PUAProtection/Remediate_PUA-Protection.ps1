.SYNOPSIS
    Attempts to remediate the device by enabling PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) protection in Windows Defender.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script enables PUA protection by setting the `-PUAProtection` flag to `Enabled` using the `Set-MpPreference` cmdlet.
    If the operation succeeds, the script outputs "Device Remediated" and exits with code 0.
    If the operation fails, it catches the error, outputs "Remediation Failed", and exits with code 1.
